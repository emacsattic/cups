;;; Commentary:

;; If you have cups on your *nix machine, this script will read your
;; conf file (usually "/etc/cups/printers.conf") and allow you to
;; change your default printer to any one, via the included
;; "choose-printer" command. This has tab completion of printer names,
;; so it's useful if you have a lot of printers -- I use it mainly
;; prior to using the dvips command in AUCTeX, but it's also useful
;; for quick printing of plain text.

;; This also has an optional menu entry. It's on by default,
;; but you can turn it off in your .emacs. See below. 
;;
;; UPDATE: I've now added a simple cache (set as ~/.emacs-cups-cache),
;; which just saves the printer list if the cups conf file hasn't
;; changed. This means that this should only slow down your startup
;; (*if* it slows down your startup) when you change your cups
;; settings.

;; To use, put the following in your ~/.emacs:
;;
;; (setq printer-conf-file "/path/to/cups/printers.conf") (setq
;; cups-printer-menu t) ;set to `nil' if you don't want menus.
;; (load-file "/path/to/this/cups.el")
;;
;; If you use Ubuntu (and maybe some other distributions) you
;; will find that it wants to make the printers.conf file only
;; readable by root after every change. (It's in the lp group,
;; but that is only given execute permission.) One suolution is
;; to just make the printer.conf file readable:
;;		
;;		chmod +r ;; /etc/cups/printers.conf 
;;
;;	If you don't want to do this... well, I'd be
;;	happy to hear any other suggestions.
;;
;; Finally, just run M-x choose-printer.

;; v0.1 - 30 0ct 2005 
;;    * First version 
;;
;; v0.2 - 15 Nov 2005 - 
;;    * Added radio buttons to the menu.
;;    * Cleaned up the menu code
;;    * Added a cache file so it won't slow down startup more than
;;      once.
